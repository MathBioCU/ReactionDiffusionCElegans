# ReactionDiffusionCElegans

This project contains work done to analyze reaction diffusion processes in C. elegans that are related to the heat shock response.

The 'scripts' directory contains all R and Mathematica code that was used to generate the figures in the paper "Pattern Formation in the Longevity-Related Expression of Heat Shock Protein-16.2 in Caenorhabditis elegans".
